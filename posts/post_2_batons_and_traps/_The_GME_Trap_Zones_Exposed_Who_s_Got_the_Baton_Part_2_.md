*Alright everyone, lab coats on ‚Äì it's time to dissect the **Trap Zones** and name some of the stocks orchestrating $GME's moves. In Part 1 we set the stage (how RoaringKitty's clues led to uncovering a hidden market melody). Now we're turning up the volume on the **actual findings**. This is where theory meets hard data.* üöÄ

**Recap in one line:** We discovered that GME's price action is passed around like a baton between different stocks/ETFs on a **weekly cycle**, with certain "trap" moments where that baton handoff happens (and chaos ensues). Now let's dive into those moments and see **who was pulling the strings, when.**

## Mapping the Baton Pass ‚Äì Week by Week, Player by Player

Using TWSCA and good old correlation analysis, I identified the **top influencer for GME each week** of 2024. Think of it as the person (ticker) holding GME's leash at that time. When you chart this out, you get a **baton map**: a timeline of which ticker had the strongest correlation to GME's moves each week (sometimes positive, sometimes negative). It's absolutely insane to look at:

![heatmap_corr_gme_cleaned.png](images/Figure02.png)

***Figure 2.2: Rolling Influence Heatmap ‚Äî GME vs Stocks (6-Week Correlation, 2024‚Äì2025)** This heatmap shows the **rolling 6-week Pearson correlation** between GME and each ticker in the influence basket. **Red = positive correlation**, where GME moves with the stock. **Blue = negative correlation**, where GME moves opposite. Striped patterns indicate **cyclical handoffs** between control stocks. Sudden shifts (color flips) often align with **trap zones** and Roaring Kitty signal events. This is the **music box's rotation matrix** ‚Äî revealing GME's hidden rhythm beneath the noise.*

- In **early 2024**, GME was moving almost in unison with fellow meme stock **KOSS** (correlation ‚âà 0.98). For a couple of weeks, if KOSS sneezed, GME caught the cold. Then mid-February, the baton shifted to **CHWY** (yes, the pet food e-tailer Ryan Cohen founded) ‚Äì not too shocking, right? Meme synergy, maybe some basket trading.
- But **by late March 2024, the baton was yanked away by freaking Microsoft**. **MSFT** showed up with a **negative correlation**. Read that again: GME's price was moving *opposite* to MSFT. Why on earth would GME inversely track a $2T tech giant? It doesn't‚Ä¶ **unless both were being manipulated in tandem**. This was the first big **"WTF" trap zone**: one week GME followed Costco (??) and the next it *inverted* to follow MSFT in reverse. If you were trading GME based on the prior trend, you walked right into a trap. *(Sound familiar? Think **Tenet** ‚Äì time inversion. This happened literally the same week RK hinted about time going backwards.)*

![Image.png](images/Figure03.png)

***Figure 2.3: Inverted Influence ‚Äî GME vs Suppressors in RK Trap Zones (LLT-Smoothed, Normalized). Zone #3 (Sep '24):** GME perfectly mirrors Unity (U). **Zone #1 (Mar '24):** GME inversely tracks MSFT. These aren't mild correlations ‚Äî they're waveform inversions. It's like GME was piped through an inverting amplifier hooked up to Unity and MSFT. **Same shape. Same timing. Reused pattern.***

- **Spring to Summer 2024** saw a parade of batons: **Costco (COST)** took a long stint as top influencer through May (GME had a bizarre ~0.99 correlation with COST for several weeks ‚Äì like **GameStop was Costco stock** üòµ). Then June hit and things went wild: we saw rapid-fire handoffs between **Target (TGT)** with negative corr (-0.994), back to **Costco** positive (0.992), then **Unity Software (U)** with negative corr (-0.963), then **iHeartMedia (IHRT)** positive (0.986). It's like the manipulators were trying *every trick in the book* to keep GME in check ‚Äì retail, tech, media, you name it. **Entropy** (our measure of influence spread) spiked as the baton bounced around. Translation: **volatility** and confusion. (Funny enough, around this time RK posted a video of an **audio cat**‚Ä¶ perhaps suggesting the cacophony of "meows" we just witnessed last June?).

![Image.png](images/Figure04.png)

***Figure 2.4: Trap Zone #2 ‚Äî DTW-Aligned Waveforms (Baton Order, LLT-Smoothed)** This chart shows GME warped to each baton holder from June 17 to July 15, 2024. Early weeks align tightly (CHWY, IHRT). Final week (MSFT) **flips**, showing inversion and confirming a baton trap. DTW reveals **shape sync even when timing shifts.***

![Image.png](images/Figure05.png)

***Figure 2.5: GME vs Weekly Influencers (June‚ÄìJuly 2024) ‚Äî Mini Bar Chart Row** Each box compares GME (black bars) against its weekly top influencer (blue bars), LLT-smoothed and normalized. Notice how alignment flips from CHWY and IHRT ‚ûù MSFT. This baton flip and sign reversal marks the **inversion trap.** Visual rhythm = **baton sync**, broken sync = trap trigger.*

- **Early July 2024 ‚Äì Trap Zone #2:** After the June madness, one player tried to regain control. Late June, IHRT (radio) had the baton with a tight grip (GME and IHRT moving together strongly with 0.986 correlation) and Ryan Cohen had her x.com profile picture as a woman (in this case HRT = Hormone Replacement Therapy). But by the week of July 8, **MSFT reappeared with a negative correlation (-0.774)**. Baton *flip!* Entropy plunged then spiked ‚Äì a classic trap signature. This time Roaring Kitty didn't explicitly tweet a clue (unless you count earlier Tenet reference carrying through), but the data screamed **inversion trap** again. For data enthusiasts tracking only positive correlations, July 8 was a rug-pull: GME started moving opposite to its prior trend. And guess who tweeted that week? **Ryan Cohen** dropped one of his cryptic one-liners (he was on an emoji or one-word tweet spree around this period, marked on our chart). Whether it was coordinated or coincidence, RC's tweets often fell on **baton handoff weeks** ‚Äì possibly stirring the pot or drawing attention while the real action (baton swap) happened behind the scenes.
- **September 2024 ‚Äì The Coldplay Chaos (Trap Zone #3):** This was the big one. GME's influence entropy hit rock bottom on **2024-09-16** (only 3.448 bits, the lowest all year). Then BAM ‚Äì the very next week it jumped to **4.032** (near the high). What happened in between? **A baton pass from COKE to U, with a sign flip.** Yep, **Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE)** had been subtly guiding GME (0.793 correlation, weird, I know) and suddenly **Unity (U)** took over with a nearly perfect negative correlation (-0.990). Two weeks in a row of Unity driving GME inverse (-0.990, -0.975). The market went from "nothing to see here, just GME oddly tracking a beverage stock" to total **upside-down world**. If that isn't *Coldplay in reverse* I don't know what is. And lo and behold, right around then was when RK posted that **backwards Coldplay clip**. He **literally signaled a big reversal**. Anyone paying attention could have anticipated something wild was coming. That trap zone saw **huge price whipsaws** in GME ‚Äì exactly what you'd expect when the puppet masters switch puppets.

![Image.png](images/Figure06.png)

***Figure 2.6: Trap Zone #3 (Sep '24) ‚Äî GME vs COKE and Inverted Unity + Entropy Breakdown** This chart shows GME's LLT-smoothed movement (black) compared to: COKE (green, pre-trap controller), Unity (U) inverted (blue, post-trap suppressor), Entropy plunges (one-player control), then spikes (baton handoff chaos). Roaring Kitty posted his Coldplay-reverse clue around this moment. This wasn't random ‚Äî it was a **full-cycle flip**. First COKE "carried" GME. Then Unity inverted it.*

- **Late Nov/Dec 2024 ‚Äì The Ghost Trap:** By late fall, things settled a bit. We got a few weeks of **Carl Icahn's IEP** showing up (with negative -0.991 correlation) ‚Äì perhaps reflecting some year-end short tactics? Then **Target (TGT)** in early Dec with -0.980 correlation followed by **XRT (Retail ETF) with +0.972** correlation. That's a **baton handoff between two short-selling vehicles** (TGT and XRT are known plays for shorting retail). Entropy fluctuated from 3.986 to 3.741 to 4.019 through December. No obvious RK clue here (he went radio silent into year-end), but interestingly **Ryan Cohen** was quite active on Twitter in late November (those "" and other odd tweets ‚Äì marked on the baton map). Could be coincidental, but pattern-wise this looked like a coordinated **short attack (TGT)** then cover/hedge via ETF (XRT). **Trap Zone #4** was more for shorts than longs ‚Äì if you were short GME expecting continued dip with TGT, you got caught when it snapped back with XRT.

I've summarized the biggest trap zones below in a quick table for clarity:

| **Trap Zone (Week)** | **Baton Handoff**              | **Entropy Drop‚ÜíSpike** | **RK/RC Clues**             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **#1: Mar 2024**     | CHWY ‚Üí MSFT (flip to negative) | 4.06 ‚Üí 3.51 ‚Üí 3.89     | RK "audio cat" hint (Mar 3) |
| **#2: Jul 2024**     | IHRT ‚Üí MSFT (flip to negative) | 3.97 ‚Üí 3.66 ‚Üí 4.01     | RC subtle tweet (Jul 8)     |
| **#3: Sep 2024**     | COKE ‚Üí U (flip to negative)    | 3.87 ‚Üí 3.45 ‚Üí 4.03     | RK posts Coldplay reverse   |
| **#4: Dec 2024**     | TGT (-) ‚Üí XRT (+)              | 3.90 ‚Üí 3.74 ‚Üí 4.02     | RC active tweets (Nov-Dec)  |

*Negative sign means inverse correlation.* Each of these was a moment where **the pattern broke and reversed**. If you were counting on the previous week's correlation to hold, **you got trapped** ‚Äì hence the term *Trap Zone*. And nearly every time, there was some heads-up if you knew where to look (cryptic tweets or unusual activity from our beloved insiders).

![Image.png](images/Figure07.png)

***Figure 2.7: Influence Entropy Over Time ‚Äî Highlighting Rising and Falling Phases** This version highlights: **Green = rising entropy** (growing instability or influence chaos). **Red = falling entropy** (re-centralization, likely trap zones) The chart now reads like a rhythm map ‚Äî where **momentum builds and resets** as influence baton passes happen behind the scenes.*

## The Proof in the Pudding: LLT Waveform Comparisons

How do we **know** these tickers actually influenced GME and it's not random? Because we can **overlay the price "waveforms"** and see it. I took GME's price and the top influencer's price in each zone and **applied the LLT smoothing** (remember, that filter that removes noise but keeps big moves). Then I lined them up in time. The result is spooky: **in each trap zone, GME and the influencer look like the same damn graph** (just scaled). When Costco was the influencer in May, GME's smoothed chart was basically a mini-Costco. During the Unity inverse period, **GME's chart was a mirror flip of U's chart** ‚Äì every rise in U matched a dip in GME, simultaneously. These weren't mild correlations; they were **near-perfect alignments** visible to the naked eye once you remove the noise.

![Image.png](images/Figure08.png)

***Figure 2.8: GME Trap Zone Waveform Alignments (with Date Ranges)** Each panel shows GME (black) vs the top influencer (blue dashed) during a ¬±2 week window surrounding a trap zone. Dates are now shown under each title so you know **when** each pattern occurred. Positive matches: same shape. Inverted matches: mirror flip. This makes it clear these weren't all one-time events ‚Äî they were **orchestrated, repeating plays** across months.*

To illustrate, in Trap Zone #3 (Sep '24), if you invert Unity's stock curve and lay it over GME's, **they match point for point** for those two weeks. It's like someone literally *plugged GME into Unity's movements* but sent the signal through an inverting amplifier. In Trap Zone #1, GME's recovery in early March was a dead ringer for MSFT's dip (again inverted). **See the pattern?** The puppet master wasn't even creative ‚Äì they reused the same trick in multiple zones (switch GME to track a big tech stock inversely whenever they needed an "anti-GME" push).

And for positive correlations: GME vs COST in May '24 ‚Äì both climbed and dipped together, with COST slightly leading. GME vs XRT in Dec ‚Äì GME basically became a smaller component of the retail ETF, moving in sync up for that week. We have charts of these in the GitHub repo if you want to see the overlays yourself (check the `notebooks/` folder in **[TheGameStopsNow/market-research](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research)** for the plotting script). It's undeniable when you see it visually.

![Image.png](images/Figure09.png)

***Figure: 2.9 Permutation Test Histogram Grid ‚Äî GME vs Key Stocks (LLT-Smoothed, 1000 Shuffles)** Each subplot shows a permutation test for GME vs another stock. Gray bars = distribution of 1000 random correlations. Red line = actual correlation. p-value < 0.05 = statistically significan.* These results show that GME's waveform aligns far beyond random chance ‚Äî these stocks aren't coincidentally correlated. They're part of the rhythm.

## Overlaying the Tweets ‚Äì The Kitty and The Chairman

I didn't forget about our protagonists: Roaring Kitty and Ryan Cohen. I plotted every RK and RC tweet on the timeline to see if they coincide with these events. **Result:** They do, more than chance would allow. RK doesn't tweet often, so the fact that **each of his enigmatic tweets aligns with a major anomaly** in the data is mind-blowing. Either he's Nostradamus, or‚Ä¶ he knew something. The **audio clip of a cat** preceded the spring cycle shift. **Tenet reference** came right before the summer inversion. **Coldplay backwards** dropped just before the September upheaval. It's like he was leaving a trail for us: "Here come the weird times ‚Äì watch closely."

![Image.png](images/Figure10.png)

**Figure 2.10: Tweet Timeline ‚Äî Roaring Kitty and Ryan Cohen (2019‚Äì2025)** Each vertical line represents a tweet. **Red = Roaring Kitty. Orange = Ryan Cohen.** This time-anchored chart reveals **patterns in timing** ‚Äî bursts, gaps, and correlations with GME volatility or trap zones. Tweet clusters often foreshadow structural changes.

![Image.png](images/Figure11_gme_influencer_overlay.png)

**Figure 2.11: Entropy Trend with RK Trap Zones and Thematic Labels** This chart shows the entropy of GME's influencer network week by week (purple line). Red shaded areas = **trap zones**, where baton control breaks down. Labelled tags mark symbolic themes from Roaring Kitty's timeline (e.g., `TENET`, `WAVEFORM`, `COLDPLAY`). These spikes and reversals in entropy signal periods of coordination disruption ‚Äî often aligning with price pivots and tweet activity.

Ryan Cohen's tweets are more frequent and less obviously related, but a pattern emerged: **RC tends to tweet during baton rotations**. In the baton map, I marked RC's tweets (orange dashed lines) and RK's (red dashed line). You can see clusters of RC lines around late June, mid-July, late Nov ‚Äì exactly when batons were flying. Correlation doesn't equal causation, but let's just say I wouldn't be surprised if RC's tweets were meant to draw attention or send a message during those volatile weeks. Remember, a well-timed üê∏ or üôÇ from the Chairman (hi, Kenny) can send the community into a frenzy ‚Äì perhaps giving cover for the market makers to do their baton switcharoo while eyes are elsewhere. Or maybe RC just has a sixth sense for when to shitpost. Either way, it lines up.

![Image.png](images/Figure12_heatmap_corr_gme.png)

***Figure 2.12: Baton map (top) and Influence Entropy (bottom) with RK-themed Trap Zone annotations.** Each blue marker in the top chart indicates the stock ticker that most strongly influenced GME's price in a given week (based on rolling correlation). The red shaded vertical bands represent identified **Trap Zones**‚Äîweeks where influence rapidly shifted and entropy surged. Labeled tags such as `TENET`, `COLDPLAY`, and `WAVEFORM` mark symbolic themes drawn from RoaringKitty's tweets, timed to match these disruptions. The lower chart tracks the **entropy** of GME's influencer network: low entropy signals control by a single dominant ticker; high entropy reveals fragmented influence and potential instability. Trap zones often appear when entropy rebounds sharply after a low point, signaling baton handoffs or manipulation resets.*

The alignment of RK's red bars with these moments is uncanny. Also note the "RyanCohen" lines tend to pepper the lead-up and aftermath of trap zones ‚Äì possibly stirring sentiment while the *action happened in dark pools.*

## What Does This Mean? (Tl;dr ‚Äì We Found the Algo and It's on a Timer)

This analysis exposes a **mechanism** behind GME's "random" moves. We've essentially **reverse engineered a piece of their algo** or strategy: it rotates GME's coupling between different assets to suppress or inflate the price as needed, creating periodic traps. **This is the music box playing the same melody over and over.** Now that we've identified the tune, we can anticipate the next verse.

For traders: it means those seemingly out-of-the-blue dips or spikes might not be so out-of-the-blue after all. There's a pattern, and now you can watch for it. If next month GME suddenly starts mirroring, say, **Apple** or **some random crypto**, you'll know a baton handoff is in progress ‚Äì and likely a trap around the corner.

![gme_influence_band_annotated_fixed.png](images/Figure13_gme_influence_band.png)

***Figure 2.13: Annotated Predictive Influence Map ‚Äî GME vs Ensemble Forecast (with Trap Zones)** GME's standardized price (black) is shown against an influence-weighted forecast derived from key tickers (CHWY, COKE, COST, BYON, SIRI). **Red line**: Ensemble projection. **Shaded band**: ¬±1œÉ from mean ‚Äî akin to a Bollinger Band based on influence rhythm. **Purple lines**: RK-themed trap zones. **Green markers**: GME broke **above** forecast range ‚Äî potential momentum / breakout. **Blue markers**: GME dropped **below** range ‚Äî signal of trap, spring, or suppression reset.* **Dune / Sandworm Reference:** The sandworm appears when **rhythmic patterns** are broken ‚Äî a metaphor for **GME escaping suppression**. The predictive band visual even resembles a worm erupting through. Tweet: [June 2024](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1801313585421029445)

For retail investors: it reinforces our conviction that **GME is heavily manipulated** ‚Äì we always knew, but here's a tangible schematic of that manipulation. They are literally **coordinating across multiple tickers and time-warping cycles** to keep GME in check. That's complex, expensive, and frankly insane ‚Äì *why go through all that trouble if GME is "just a dying retailer," right?* üòâ

Most importantly, **what happens if the music stops?** What if one day the baton is dropped ‚Äì say, the primary influencer fails to keep GME pinned and no other stock is ready to tag in? We might see GME break out of the rhythm‚Ä¶ maybe **go parabolic**. If the cycle coordination falters (due to exhaustion of resources, or **too much public awareness**), the whole scheme could unravel. It would be like a music box grinding to a halt, and all that pent-up energy releasing at once. In layman's terms: **MOASS tune intensifies**.

## Reproducing, Watching Forward & Tuning into the Hidden Beat

I'm not just dumping DD and walking away. I've open-sourced everything: data, code, and clear step-by-step instructions available on GitHub at **[TheGameStopsNow](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow)**. Fellow wrinkle-brains, your mission‚Äîshould you choose to accept‚Äîis to replicate this analysis, challenge every finding, and strengthen our collective insight. This is war, and the more data-savvy eyes we have watching these correlations, the stronger our defenses.

Set up your cron jobs, track real-time correlation shifts, and together we can anticipate the next baton pass *as it happens*. Imagine a Superstonk thread alerting the community: "Heads up! GME's tethered to XRT again‚Äîentropy's dropping, brace for a potential trap flip!" That's our edge, our early-warning system.

To the skeptics out there: Could parts of this be coincidence? Maybe‚Äîinitially. But when you stack up the **consistency, precise timing linked with known events or cryptic tweets, and statistically robust correlations**, the chances shrink to virtually zero. The influencer stocks weren't cherry-picked after the fact; they were selected in advance based on prior observations and logical ties (hello, XRT!). The analysis could have fizzled out; instead, it exposed a deliberate rotation, precise baton handoffs, and undeniable manipulation signals. That's not noise‚Äîthat's a coded melody.

And speaking of melodies: **we've cracked part of the code**. Roaring Kitty hinted we listen differently‚Äîso we did. Now we're tuning in clearly, hearing the rhythmic ticking of the clockwork behind GME. To the puppeteers orchestrating this little market symphony: **we see you**. Your once-secret composition is echoing loudly, and every baton handoff you attempt will now have a thousand vigilant listeners. üéß‚è±Ô∏è

**But we're just getting started.** In Part 3, we're diving deeper‚Äîrefining our detection tools, capturing new baton handoffs, and exploring how the rhythm might be evolving. Has the market's hidden beat changed tempo? Has the cycle stretched or flipped, hiding new surprises? Spoiler alert: *the band is still playing*, and we've just tuned our instruments to hear it better.

So if you found this as mind-blowing as I did, share it far and wide, keep the discussion alive, and prepare for more revelations. The truth is out there in the data, and we're not stopping until every last note is exposed. Because when the music stops‚Äîor even just skips‚Äîwe'll be ready.
