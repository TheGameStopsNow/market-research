*Remember Roaring Kitty's bizarre tweets – an audio clip of a cat, a reference to Nolan's **Tenet**, and even a Coldplay song played backwards?* These weren't just shitposts. I believe they were clues, nudging us to look at $GME in a whole new way. Get ready – I put on my lab coat and **turned GME's chart into a music sheet**, using a novel Time-Warped Spectral Correlation Analysis (TWSCA) to expose a **repeating market rhythm** hidden beneath the chaos. This is data warfare, and **I'm firing my warning shot**.💥

## From Cryptic Tweets to a Theory of Market Rhythm

Those cryptic Roaring Kitty (RK) posts got me thinking: What if GME's price moves aren't noise, but **music** – a coordinated cycle, remixed and repeated by hidden players? Imagine different **"instruments" (stocks or indices)** taking turns to carry the tune of GME's price. One week it's moving in lockstep with a retail ETF, next week it's dancing to a tech stock's beat. It's as if there's a **conductor behind the scenes**, rotating through players on a schedule – **passing a baton** to keep the rhythm going and retail traders confused.


![Figure_1_1_cat-signal-roaringkitty-tweet.jpeg](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_1_cat-signal-roaringkitty-tweet.jpeg?raw=true)

- **Audio Cat:** RK's [meowing audio hint](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1cud9g6/the_weird_audio_in_roaringkittys_last_tweet_as_an/) made me consider treating price data like sound waves. Could GME's chart contain a *signal* you'd only catch if you listened differently? [[x.com](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791540437968392518)]
- **Tenet (Time Inversion):** The reference to *Tenet* (a film about reversing time) suggested some parts of the cycle might be **playing in reverse or out of phase**. Perhaps GME's pattern isn't strictly periodic – maybe segments are **stretched, delayed, or flipped**, hiding the true cycle unless you allow for time-warps. [[x.com](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790826988019528035)]
- **Coldplay in Reverse:** A Coldplay song that has the video play backwards… that screamed *"look for a hidden melody"*. Maybe the real movement of GME is like a song that only makes sense when played back the right way. In other words, **standard analysis = listening forwards, but the truth = hiding in reverse.** [[x.com](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1791551762295337243)]
- **Ready Player One (Reverse Clue)**: RK specifically highlighted the *Ready Player One* scene where Parzival realizes he must **"go backward to go forward."** This mirrors RK's ongoing theme of reversing cycles, reinforcing the idea that understanding GME's patterns might require thinking in reverse chronological or cyclical terms ([Tweet #1](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400124740291923968/video/1), [Tweet #2](https://x.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1790049362846117942)).

So here's the theory I formed: **GME's price is being choreographed in cycles**. It's like a **music box**: wind it up (coordinate the players), and it plays the same tune (price pattern) over and over, while outsiders hear only noise. **Trap cycles** reset at key points – if you're caught on the wrong side when the "baton" passes, you get rekt. I set out to prove this hidden structure exists.

## Enter TWSCA – Time-Warped Spectral Correlation Analysis (WTF is that?)

Detecting an **engineered market rhythm** isn't trivial. Regular correlation or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis wasn't enough – the bastards hide their tracks too well by **shifting timing and swapping players**. I needed a way to sniff out a repeating pattern that **doesn't line up perfectly in time** and can **jump between different stocks**. Enter **TWSCA**, my secret sauce. In plain English:

- **Think of GME and other stocks as songs.** TWSCA tries to find if GME's "song" is a remix of others, even if the DJs speed it up, slow it down, or play it backwards. It uses a form of dynamic time warping (from speech recognition tech) to **align similar patterns that are out of sync**. If they stretched a cycle from 5 days to 6 days, this can catch it.

![Figure_1_2_rolling-correlation-dtw-gme-chwy.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_2_rolling-correlation-dtw-gme-chwy.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Rolling Correlation vs DTW Distance — GME vs CHWY (LLT-Smoothed, Weekly)** This dual-axis chart compares **rolling 6-week correlation** (blue) and **dynamic time-warping (DTW) distance** (red) between GME and CHWY. Correlation spikes often align with drops in DTW, confirming that when CHWY tightly tracks GME in both timing and shape, it's likely leading or anchoring the cycle. These dips in DTW can signal baton sync periods.*

- **We combine frequency analysis with flexibility.** Traditional spectral analysis looks for cycles of a fixed length. I added a twist: allow the cycle to **warp in time** a bit (like rubber-banding the timeline) and see if GME's frequency pattern matches, say, XRT's or SPY's when you allow a little slippage. This **finds hidden correlations** that a normal correlation would miss.

![Figure_1_3_timewarp-overlay-grid-gme-influencers.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_3_timewarp-overlay-grid-gme-influencers.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Timewarp Overlay Grid — GME vs Influencer Stocks (LLT Smoothed, Normalized)** Each subplot shows GME overlaid with one potential influencer, LLT-smoothed and standardized. Stocks like **CHWY, COKE, COST** mirror GME directly. Stocks like **BYON, SIRI, IEP** show strong inverse patterns. **TGT, XRT** show intermittent alignment — possible structural traps.*

![Figure_1_4_dtw-warping-paths-gme-influencers.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_4_dtw-warping-paths-gme-influencers.png?raw=true)

**Figure: DTW Warping Paths — GME vs Influencer Stocks (LLT-Smoothed)** Each subplot shows the dynamic alignment between GME and another stock using Dynamic Time Warping. **Diagonal paths** = in sync. **Horizontal/vertical stretches** = lag or suppression. Mirror effects (BYON, SIRI) show up as abrupt directional changes. These paths reveal not just *whether* two stocks match — but *how and when* they move in sync.

- **Local Laplacian Transform (LLT) smoothing = noise filter.** Before matching patterns, I applied an edge-preserving smoothing on the price series (LLT filter) to remove random noise but **keep the big jumps intact**. Imagine cleaning an old audio recording: we drop the static so the melody stands out (Time-Warped Spectral Correlation Analysis (TWSCA) in Financial Time Series.md) (Time-Warped Spectral Correlation Analysis (TWSCA) in Financial Time Series.md). This way, when GME's price "jumps" because of an event, we still see it, but the day-to-day jiggles are muted.

![Figure_1_5_llt-smoothing-example.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_5_llt-smoothing-example.png?raw=true)

- **Symbolic tagging of events.** I even converted certain patterns into symbols (like marking whenever our kitty overlord tweeted, or when a correlation flipped negative) so I could map them easily. This is like adding sheet music annotations on the chart: **cat emoji when RK posted a cat, snowflake+guitar when Coldplay was hinted**, etc. It sounds goofy, but it helped connect the dots between **tweets and market moves**.

Why is TWSCA novel? Because **nobody's crazy enough to do all this at once in finance** (until now). It's a Frankenstein of signal processing techniques purpose-built for this GME puzzle. Standard algos assume steady cycles or single correlations; **we know GME is a damn chameleon** – we've seen it run when *KOSS* ran, or dump with *SPY*, then decouple entirely. TWSCA can catch those sneaky switch-ups by design.

![Figure_1_6_phase-inverted-overlay-gme-byon.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_6_phase-inverted-overlay-gme-byon.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Phase-Inverted Overlay — GME vs BYON (LLT-Smooth, Normalized)** This chart compares GME to the inverse of BYON using LLT-smoothed weekly prices, normalized to highlight structure. A mirrored alignment like this suggests BYON may have been used as a **suppressive counterweight** — when BYON rises, GME falls, and vice versa. The rhythm matches almost perfectly over several months.*

![Figure_1_7_signal-reconstruction-gme-unity.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_7_signal-reconstruction-gme-unity.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Signal Reconstruction — GME Warped onto Unity's Cycle (LLT-Smoothed, Normalized)** This chart compares the LLT-smoothed and normalized prices of GME and Unity (U). The red line is GME **dynamically time-warped** to match Unity's recent cycle. Strong structural overlap implies that GME's price may be **shadowing Unity's underlying pattern**, adjusted for tempo and lag — suggesting potential manipulation via mirrored movement.*

![Figure_1_8_control-band-overlay-gme-chwy-gis-byon.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_8_control-band-overlay-gme-chwy-gis-byon.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Control Band Overlay — GME vs CHWY, GIS, BYON (LLT Smoothed, Normalized)** This plot shows GME compared to three other tickers using LLT-smoothing and normalization. **CHWY** overlays closely, suggesting strong structural alignment. **GIS** wanders off, showing little to no influence. **BYON** matches **inverted** — suggesting a possible role as a suppressive counterweight. Visual structure reveals which stocks "move with" GME vs which "move against" or not at all.*

![Figure_1_9_correlation-lag-offset-gme-tickers.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_9_correlation-lag-offset-gme-tickers.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Correlation by Lag Offset — GME vs Key Tickers (2024–2025, Weekly)** Each line shows the correlation between GME and another stock at different week offsets. **CHWY** and **COKE** peak near lag 0 → real-time or slightly lagging rhythm. **BYON** shows strong negative correlation at –3 → likely used as a counterweight. **TGT** and **SPY** fluctuate → less consistent alignment, maybe cyclical or structural*

## Building the "Music Box" – Data & Tools

I pulled weekly data for GME **and a bunch of suspects**: "meme" stocks (KOSS, CHWY), sector ETFs (XRT – hi shorts!, SPY), big tech (MSFT), random picks that popped up in prior DDs (COST, TGT, etc.), even a freaking radio company (IHRT) and *Icahn Enterprises (IEP)* just in case. If the theory holds, each week one of these **"influencer" tickers will show an unusually high correlation with GME** – that's the one holding the baton. The **entropy of correlations** (think of it as how spread out vs. concentrated the influence is) should **drop** when one player dominates (baton firmly in hand) and **spike** when the baton is tossed mid-air (handoff period, chaos).

I wrote code to compute rolling correlations for each week and identify the **Top Influencer** driving GME. Then compute entropy of all those correlations to mark **trap zones** (big changes in influence concentration). Everything is scripted in Python, and guess what – I'm sharing it. **You can reproduce ALL of this**. I've uploaded the datasets, code, and scripts to GitHub (**[TheGameStopsNow/market-research](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research)**). If you're a data enthusiast, clone it and see for yourself. If you're not, don't worry – I'm about to show you the highlights*.*

![Figure_1_10_influencer-baton-grid-traps.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_10_influencer-baton-grid-traps.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Influencer Hot Zones — GME Weekly Correlation > 0.6** This binary heatmap shows when each stock had a **strong correlation (>|0.6|)** with GME, week by week. **CHWY**, **COKE**, and **SPY** show **persistent influence. BYON**, **SIRI**, and **TGT** rotate in briefly — likely used during trap cycles. Clearly shows baton-passing dynamic and **timing of control rotation.***

## The Hidden Structure Reveals Itself

Even with just the teaser above, patterns emerge. **GME's "song" is real.** We see periods where one ticker holds sway for weeks (low entropy, one instrument soloing) and abrupt moments where everything changes (entropy spikes – the band switches instruments). For example, in mid-2024 one stock (Costco, of all things) led GME's movement for nearly a month straight. Then suddenly in late September, **no single stock was consistently leading** – a *new* player jumped in with a *negative correlation* (think mirror image, as if GME's price was being actively countered) and multiple others briefly spiked influence. That's a major **baton pass trap**: the kind of event that could trap shorts or longs depending on who expected what.

![Figure_1_11_lag-timing-heatmap-gme-trap-zones.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_11_lag-timing-heatmap-gme-trap-zones.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Influencer Baton Grid — Weekly GME Control with RK Trap Zones** This chart the weekly top influencer over GME, with **filled squares** indicating influence. Soft red columns = RK-labeled trap zones. Filled cells = who held the baton that week.*

Crucially, some of these events line up with the **Roaring Kitty clues**: one major cycle inversion happened soon after RK's **Tenet** hint (coincidence? I think not), and the biggest chaotic handoff of the year followed his **Coldplay-in-reverse** tweet (we'll detail that in Part 2). It's like he was saying *"pay attention, something's about to reverse"*. And boy, did it.

What this **suggests** is a coordinated playbook. The **bad actors** (hedgies, algos, whoever) aren't just randomly messing with GME – they're **cycling through strategies**. When one stock (or basket) gets too obvious, they switch to another. When a positive correlation play is exhausted, they might flip short (negative corr) for a bit. These handoffs create predictable turbulence – **trap zones – where retail can get ambushed** by sudden moves that seemingly come out of nowhere. Well, I just *found* those "nowhere" signals. They were always there, hidden in the noise.

![Figure_1_12_max-correlation-barplot-gme.png](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research/blob/main/posts/post_01_timewarp/post_01-GME_Timewarp-Decoding_RoaringKittys_Clues/.assets/Figure_1_12_max-correlation-barplot-gme.png?raw=true)

***Figure: Max correlation and lag offset vs GME (2024–2025, weekly).** Left chart shows each ticker's maximum observed correlation with GME after adjusting for lag. Right chart shows the **optimal lead/lag** in weeks. Negative lag = ticker led GME; positive lag = GME moved first. CHWY, COST, and COKE show tight alignment; SIRI and BYON act as structural inverters. These patterns mirror the baton handoffs and entropy spikes seen in Trap Zones.*

## What's Next (Part 2 Preview)

In Part 2, I'm going to break down each major **Trap Zone** in detail: when it happened, which players passed the baton, how it shows up in the data (with charts and tables straight from the analysis), and how it eerily lines up with our favorite cat's riddles and even some of Ryan Cohen's well-timed tweets. We'll look at **LLT-smoothed "waveform" comparisons** of GME vs. its top influencers (ever seen GME and Costco move together like twins? You will), and a timeline of **who really controlled GME week-by-week** through 2024. Consider Part 1 the theory and setup – Part 2 is the evidence, served cold 🍦.

Before you move on, **check out the GitHub ([TheGameStopsNow/market-research](https://github.com/TheGameStopsNow/market-research))**. All the code, data, and even visual outputs are there for the community. I want **all of you to be able to verify and play with this.** This isn't trust-me DD; it's **see-for-yourself**. If I'm onto something, you should be able to catch these patterns in real time going forward – imagine **outsmarting the algorithms at their own game**. Sound ambitious? Maybe. But that's what we do here.

*Stay tuned for Part 2. The music box is about to be opened, and it's gonna get loud.* 🎶🔥

+ # Appendix 1 – Market Karaoke & TWSCA Reproducibility
    - **Data:** We used GME's daily price data spanning Jan 2020–Dec 2024 (obtained via Yahoo Finance) as our main input for detecting the hidden cycle phenomena in Post 1. This dataset is included in the repo under `post_1_timewarp/data/`. The folder also holds a handful of comparison stocks (e.g. CHWY, SPY, and others) in CSV form so you can replicate the "who's carrying the tune?" correlation checks.
    - **Code:** The analysis and figures for Post 1 are generated by the Python script `post_1_timewarp/run_analysis.py`. It uses our custom **TWSCA** (Time-Warped Spectral Correlation Analysis) package (version 0.3.0) to uncover cyclical patterns even when they're phase-shifted or slightly stretched. We also utilize the built-in **Local Laplacian Transform** (LLT) filtering in TWSCA 0.3.0 (to preserve big moves but filter out random noise).
    - **Parameters & Settings:** Key configuration if you want an exact replication:
        1. **TWSCA** max warping ±5 days, frequency band [0.02–0.5 cycles/day] to capture multi-day cycles.
        2. **LLT** smoothing set with `sigma=1.5` and `alpha=0.5` to preserve GME's larger price swings (note: alpha must be between 0-1 in TWSCA 0.3.0).
        3. **Correlation window** for rolling analysis: 6-week blocks, updated weekly (so it slides by 1 week each time).
        4. We set a fixed random seed (`seed=42`) whenever random sampling was used.
    - **Running the Analysis:**
        1. Clone the GitHub repo and navigate to the `post_1_timewarp/` directory.
        2. Run the analysis script: `python run_analysis.py`
        3. The script will automatically: (a) load GME and comparison-stock CSVs, (b) apply LLT smoothing, (c) run TWSCA on GME vs each potential "influencer," (d) generate rolling correlation plots, and (e) highlight which weeks had the strongest alignment.
        4. The script will produce a visualization that color-codes each influencer's correlation by week (the so-called "baton map").
    - **Output Verification:** When the script completes, you should see logs like "CHWY alignment cost: 14.86 (peak correlation 0.99)" or "SPY alignment cost: 24.75 (peak correlation 0.92)" – the same lines we referenced in Post 1. The script also saves the main figure, `timewarp_baton_grid.png`, in `post_1_timewarp/figures/`. Compare to the visuals from Post 1 to confirm you're matching our results.
    - **Contribute:** Feel free to experiment with different smoothing parameters or add new comparison stocks. If you spot a surprising "baton pass" that we didn't mention, open an issue or submit a pull request! As we discovered in Post 1, the market is sneaky – the more eyes and variations we throw at it, the better we can pin down the hidden "music box" cycle. Apes helping apes.
